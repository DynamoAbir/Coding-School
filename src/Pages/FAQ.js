          <p>
            Pursuing a college degree in web development, computer science, or
            computer programming takes 8-10 months, depending on whether you get
            an associate degree or a bachelor's degree. This is the longest path
            to becoming a web developer.

            Becoming an expert in AI will enable you to challenge current ways
            of working and change the way you perceive most things. Highlighting
            yourself as someone who strives for positive change, as well as an
            eagerness to learn the latest technologies could take you a long way
            in your career.The goal is to create computer intelligence
            programmes that can handle real-time problems and help organizations
            and everyday people achieve their goals. Machine games, speech
            recognition, language detection, computer vision, expert systems,
            robotics, and other fields have potential. However, we actually
            recommend using both Flowbite, Flowbite Pro, and even Tailwind UI as
            there is no technical reason stopping you from using the best of two
            worlds.
